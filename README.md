ue4-starter-content
===================

The `Starter Content` provided by Unreal Engine 4, but packaged in a format suitable for composer.

Just add to your `composer.json` and run `composer`:

```json
  "require": {
    "soundasleep/ue4-starter-content": "*"
  }
```

*NOTE* Has plenty of caveats and limitations, as described at the sample
[ue4-GettingStarted](https://github.com/soundasleep/ue4-GettingStarted) project.
